    "Since [Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1993636.1993682 ) proved that applying a passive linear interferometer with input Fock states cannot be efficiently simulated by a classical computer because it's a problem of computing the permanent of large complex valued matrices which is of complexity class P-Complete, the search for concrete application for the boson sampling problem emerged. Despite being a non universal quantum computer, photonic quantum computers which implement boson sampling have been proven to be far less experimentally demanding when compared to other standard photonic quantum computers with full implementation of linear optics. This is so since it only requires passive optical elements (beamsplitters, phase_shifts and photodetector).\n",
    "Despite all of the above, boson sampling still struggles to find practical use because of the randomness of the boson sampling results. We therefore want to exploit that randomness as a source of a quantum random number generator QRNG). \n",
    "Despite the boson sampling problem not being able to be simulated with classical computer without exponential ressources, the output of a boson sampler doesn't necessary generate a completely random output. We therefore require post processing using The Von Neumann correction method."

    "single photons are generated using nonlinear crystals through Spontaneous Parametric down conversion (SPDC) or Spontaneous Four Wave Mixing (SPFWM) in a probabilistic process (non-deterministic). In the case for example of the SPDC, with a strong coherent pump, a pair of photons is generated (signal and idler photon). A photodetector is put on the signal where a photon detection will ensure we know there is a photon in the idler due to quantum correlations. The idler photon will be rooted to one of the input of the boson samplers. And that is an example of how an input single photon mode is generated.\n",

The most common applications for the network of linear optical elements are Reck design and Clements design. Clements optical netwrok design is proven to be more robust against photon losses and offers an optimal linear optical network arrangement. \n",

    "QNRG can be used on the generation of crypto-keys. Given that a boson sampler can generate states sampled from \"almost\" uniform probability distributions, one expects more random string of numbers (after post-processing) than those generated by classical pseudo-random number generators. This in turn offers stronger an hard to break protocols when creating crypto-keys, say for example those needed by finacial transactions.  \n",

    "Another possible uses of QNRG are in physical simulations. Boson samplers could be used to generate truly random numbers and this can then be used in classical computers or other quantum computers to simulate physical situations more accurately. "
